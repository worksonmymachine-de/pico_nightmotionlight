# pico_nightmotionlight
A motion triggered night light

Python code for a combination of Raspberry Pico, an motion sensor, a light sensor and a led.

Led and Sensor classes are optional and used for abstraction and for nicer code as I don't like the micropython machine.Pin interface so much.
Will include a base version without them.
